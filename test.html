    <h1>Introduction to DevOps</h1>
    <p class="definition">
        DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
    </p>
    <p>
        DevOps is not just a technology or a tool but a cultural shift that fosters collaboration, communication, and integration between development and operations teams. It aims to automate and monitor the process of software integration, testing, deployment, and infrastructure changes.
    </p>
